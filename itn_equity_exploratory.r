# The cut points in the wealth index at which to form the quintiles are
# calculated by obtaining a weighted frequency distribution of households,
# the weight being the product of the number of de jure members of the
# household and the sampling weight of the household.
# Thus, the distribution represents the national household population,
# where each member is given the wealth index score of his or her household.
# The persons are then ordered by the score, and the distribution is
# divided at the points that form the five 20- percent sections.
# Then the household score is recoded into the quintile variable so
# that each member of a household also receives that householdâ€™s
# quintile category. 

# Let's see if we can recreate this
